//! HTTP client for the Google People API v1 — used solely to resolve a
//! Google Chat user id (`users/{id}`, as it appears in a message's
//! `sender.name`) to that user's display name.
//!
//! Kept separate from `client.rs`'s `GoogleChatClient`: this is a different
//! external API entirely (`people.googleapis.com`, not `chat.googleapis.com`),
//! with its own scope (`directory.readonly`) and its own resource-name
//! convention (`people/{id}`, not `users/{id}` — though the numeric id
//! portion is the same underlying Google account id for both). This exists
//! because the Chat API itself does not expose a user's display name under
//! either of this crate's auth modes: per Google's docs, "if your Chat app
//! authenticates as a user, the output for a User resource only populates
//! the user's name and type" — and both this crate's auth modes (service
//! account + domain-wide delegation, and 3LO) are "user auth" from the Chat
//! API's perspective, since neither requests the `chat.bot` scope. Uses the
//! same bearer access token as `GoogleChatClient`/`EventsClient` — different
//! scope, same OAuth identity, no separate auth flow.
//!
//! Only resolves users within the same Google Workspace domain as the
//! authenticated identity — a documented, accepted limitation (see
//! BACKLOG.md GCHAT-5).
